   determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.There are N submissions, numbered 1 through N. 
   For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji (in minutes). Submitting and 
   judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than
