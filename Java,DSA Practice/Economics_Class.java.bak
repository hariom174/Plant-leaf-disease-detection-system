/* Alice has recently learned in her economics class that the market is said to be in equilibrium when the 
   supply is equal to the demand.Alice has market data for N time points in the form of two integer arrays 
   S and D. Here, Si denotes the supply at the ith point of time and Di denotes the demand at the ith point of 
   time, for each 1≤i≤N.
   Help Alice in finding out the number of time points at which the market was in equilibrium. */
