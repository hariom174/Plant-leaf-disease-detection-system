/* Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, he finishes it in 
   m*x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time. 
   Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work. */
