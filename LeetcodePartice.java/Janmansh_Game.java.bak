/* Janmansh and Jay are playing a game. They start with a number X and they play a total of Y moves. Janmansh 
   plays the first move of the game, after which both the players make moves alternatingly.
   In one move, a player can increment or decrement X by 1.If the final number after performing Y moves is even,
   then Janmansh wins otherwise, Jay wins. Determine the winner of the game if h the players play optimally. */
