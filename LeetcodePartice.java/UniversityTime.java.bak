 /* There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes 
  wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's 
  usage in order to avoid the conflicts:
 -> The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later 
   than at the time A1.
 -> The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later 
   than at the time A2.
 -> And so on.
 -> The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later 
   than at the time AN
  * The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. 
   The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook.
  *  The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. 
    How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule? */
