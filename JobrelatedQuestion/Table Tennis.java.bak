/* Chef likes to play table tennis. He found some statistics of matches which described who won 
   the points in order. A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points except in the 
   case when both players have 10 points each, then the game shall be won by the first player 
   subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. Could you please help the Chef find out who the winner
   was from the given statistics? (It is guaranteed that statistics represent always a valid,
   finished match.)*/
