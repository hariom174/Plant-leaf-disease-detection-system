/* Chef opened a company which manufactures cars and bikes. Each car requires 4 tyres while each bike requires 
   2 tyres. Chef has a total of N tyres (N is even). He wants to manufacture maximum number of cars from these 
   tyres and then manufacture bikes from the remaining tyres.Chef's friend went to Chef to purchase a bike. 
   If Chef's company has manufactured even a single bike then Chef's friend will be able to purchase it.
   Determine whether he will be able to purchase the bike or not. */
