/* Chef has bought a new robot, which will be used for delivering dishes to his customers. He started testing 
   the robot by letting it move on a line.
   Initially, the robot is placed at the coordinate x=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of N commands, 
   described by a string S with length N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the 
   robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing x by 1) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.
   How many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point p is visited
   by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p. */
